// Coding Challenge #4

/* 
1. Re-create challenge #3, but this time using ES6 classes: create an 'EVCl' child class of the 'CarCl' class
2. Make the 'charge' property private;
3. Implement the ability to chain the 'accelerate' and 'chargeBattery' methods of this class, and also update the 'brake' method in the 'CarCl' class. They experiment with chining!

DATA CAR 1: 'Rivian' going at 120 km/h, with a charge of 23%

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
